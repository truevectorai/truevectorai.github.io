...is a semi-retired ever-curious specialized-generalist, who lived as a child for several years with his dirt-poor grandparents (near literally, as their floor was actually unfinished wood) on a too-big tenant-farm, with a first paying-job as a department-store janitor while in high school (but with talent suitably recognized, was rapidly upgraded to cleaning the gerbil cages after less than a month), moving into house carpentry and construction to make enough money for, and continuing that occupation throughout, college, with (likely excessive) extracurricular activities as a sports photographer, then a career as a USAF officer, followed by a brief stint as a private investor, publicly-traded-company board member, then appointed by a federal judge as a small-cap CEO to effect recovery of embezzled funds which involved some international detective work, on to participating in an aviation manufacturing startup, and finally scraping the rust off the degree and engaging as a cyber-security systems-engineer in the IT field for the last couple of decades, though frequently enjoying the odd foray into new domains along the way.

# on specialists

"The dilemma is this. In the modern world knowledge has been growing so fast and so enormously, in almost every field, that the probabilities are immensely against anybody, no matter how innately clever, being able to make a contribution in any one field unless he devotes all his time to it for years. If he tries to be the Rounded Universal Man, like Leonardo da Vinci, or to take all knowledge for his province, like Francis Bacon, he is most likely to become a mere dilettante and dabbler. But if he becomes too specialized, he is apt to become narrow and lopsided, ignorant on every subject but his own, and perhaps dull and sterile even on that because he lacks perspective and vision and has missed the cross-fertilization of ideas that can come from knowing something of other subjects."

# on generalists

"A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects."

Specialized Generalist - aka one who cannot make up his mind...

"These are the principles for the development of a complete mind: Study the science of art. Study the art of science. Learn to see. Realize that everything connects to everything else."

[Leonardo da Vinci](https://philosophynow.org/issues/134/The_Mind_of_Leonardo_da_Vinci)

"I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail."

[Maslow's Hammer](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hammer#English)

Without a broad foundation, it's facile to slide into [confirmation bias](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1037/1089-2680.2.2.175) by "seeking or interpreting of evidence in ways that are partial to existing beliefs".

The astute reader will notice the occasional academic *faux pas* of linking to Wikipedia article.  What contrarian blush has come over the author?

## navigation
The speed and direction of a target relative to a reference point (usually the Geographic [true] North Pole) is called its *true vector*, and is where this site drew the inspiration for its name, though from the similar application in aviation. To calcuate this an observer generally measures the velocity of the target relative to the observer and then performs a translation of that vector to the reference point.

## physics
A true vector or radius vector reverses sign if the coordinate axes are reversed. Examples of polar vectors include r, the velocity vector v, momentum p, and force F.

## math
A true vector or polar vector is a representation of a vector as a magnitude (length) and angle, which is equivalent to specifying its endpoints in polar coordinates.

## ai
A *true vector* as defined in the *navigation* tab could be likened in machine learning (well, at least by me) to attempting to determine the "goldilocks" (neither underfit nor overfit) prediction path by application of optimization algorithms to datasets of observations.
