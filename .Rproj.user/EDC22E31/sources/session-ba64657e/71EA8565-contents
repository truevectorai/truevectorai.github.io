Rosalind Picard introduced the term in her 1995 paper [Affective Computing](https://affect.media.mit.edu/pdfs/95.picard.pdf) (and followed up with the cited 2000 book [@picard2000] by the same name) in which she postulated in the Abstract that

> Computers are beginning to acquire the ability to express and recognize affect, and may soon be given the ability to "have emotions." The essential role of emotion in both human cognition and perception, as demonstrated by recent neurological studies, indicates that affective computers should not only provide better performance in assisting humans, but also might enhance computers' abilities to make decisions. This paper presents and discusses key issues in "affective computing," computing that relates to, arises from, or influences emotions. Models are suggested for computer recognition of human emotion, and new applications are presented for computer-assisted learning, perceptual information retrieval, arts and entertainment, and human health and interaction. Affective computing, coupled with new wearable computers, will also provide the ability to gather new data necessary for advances in emotion and cognition theory.
