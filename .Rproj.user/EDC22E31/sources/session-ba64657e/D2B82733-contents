## navigation

The speed and direction of a target relative to a reference point (usually the Geographic \[true\] North Pole) is called its *true vector*, and is where this site drew the inspiration for its name, though from the similar application in aviation. If done with modern sonar there is some [beamforming](https://man.fas.org/dod-101/navy/docs/es310/asw_sys/asw_sys.htm_) to give an angle (bearing) to the reflection (target), while older submarines would have had much less angular precision and would have to rely on more on estimation of own movement to calculate a phase shift in returned signals after a known time and distance change of the observer. Fighter aircraft radar is similar though modern airborne radar can be steered very specifically and precisely with [high resolution](https://www.armadainternational.com/2022/05/airborne-aesa-fighter-radars/). To calcuate this an observer generally measures the velocity of the target relative to the observer and then performs a translation (with ever more useful computational capability) of that vector to the reference point.
