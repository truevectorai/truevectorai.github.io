The earliest use I've found of the term [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) is in the title of a paper by *Arthur Samuel* [@samuel1959] which opens with:

> The studies reported here have been concerned with the programming of a digital computer to behave in a way which, if done by human beings or animals, would be described as involving the process of learning.
