To calcuate this an observer generally measures the velocity of the target relative to the observer and then performs a translation of that vector to the reference point. This could be likened in machine learning (well, at least by me) to attempting to determine the “goldilocks” (neither underfit nor overfit) prediction curve by application of optimization algorithms to datasets of observations.\n\n\n\nMultiple passes of meandering musings, including but not limited to the rather broad field of artificial intelligence along with its various foci of effort.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe meandering muser is a semi-retired generalist, living as a child for several years with his (literally) dirt-poor grandparents on a too-big farm, starting work as a department store janitor in high school (but with talent rapidly recognized, was upgraded to cleaning the gerbil cages after less than a month), moving into house carpentry and construction to make enough money for and continuing that occupation throughout college, as a sports photographer, then a career as a USAF officer, followed by a brief stint as a private investor, publicly-traded-company board member, then appointed by a federal judge as a small-cap CEO to effect recovery of embezzled funds which involved some international detective work, on to participating in an aviation manufacturer startup, and finally scraping the rust off the degree and engaging as a cyber security systems engineer in the IT field for the last couple of decades, but frequently enjoying the odd job in new domains along the way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\non generalists\n\n\n\n\n\n“A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly.

    "text": "In (TURING 1950) Alan Turing came up with his eponymous Turing Test by rewriting his opening question “Can machines think?”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe Turing test\n\n\n\n\n\nAlan Turing wasn’t vain enough to have named his thought exercise after himself, and as seen below he called it The Imitation Game. I’ve not found who proposed renaming the concept after him.\n\n\n\n\nI PROPOSE to consider the question, ‘Can machines think?’ This should begin with definitions of the meaning of the terms ‘machine’ and ‘think’. The definitions might be framed so as to reflect so far as possible the normal use of the words, but this attitude is dangerous. If the meaning of the words ‘machine’ and ‘think’ are to be found by examining how they are commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the meaning and the answer to the question, ‘Can machines think?’ is to be sought in a statistical survey such as a Gallup poll. But this is absurd. Instead of attempting such a definition I shall replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words.\n\n\nThe new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the ‘imitation game’. It is played with three people, a man (A), a woman (B), and an interrogator (C) who may be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart from the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at the end of the game he says either ‘X is A and Y is B’ or ‘X is B and Y is A’. The interrogator is allowed to put questions to A and B thus:\n\n\nC: Will X please tell me the length of his or her hair? Now suppose X is actually A, then A must answer. It is A’s object in the game to try and cause C to make the wrong identification. His answer might therefore be\n\n\n‘My hair is shingled, and the longest strands are about nine inches long.’\n\n\nIn order that tones of voice may not help the interrogator the answers should be written, or better still, typewritten. The ideal arrangement is to have a teleprinter communicating between the two rooms. Alternatively the question and answers can be repeated by an intermediary. The object of the game for the third player (B) is to help the interrogator. The best strategy for her is probably to give truthful answers. She can add such things as ‘I am the woman, don’t listen to him!’ to her answers, but it will avail nothing as the man can make similar remarks.\n\n\nWe now ask the question, ‘What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game?’ Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace our original, ‘Can machines think?’\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nTURING, A.
